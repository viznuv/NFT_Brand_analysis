# NFT Brand Equity Analysis Framework

This research framework investigates how brand equity influences the perceived value and purchase intention of NFTs over time, suitable for a high-tier academic publication (PNAS/Nature level).

## Overview

The analysis examines how established brands (e.g., Nike, Adidas) affect NFT valuation compared to crypto-native and emerging creators, with a focus on temporal trends and market dynamics.

## Key Features

- **Comprehensive Brand Equity Metrics**: Implements 10 sophisticated brand equity dimensions including brand awareness, loyalty, perceived quality, and brand resonance
- **Temporal Analysis**: Incorporates time lags to capture dynamic effects across multiple time horizons
- **Advanced Econometric Methods**: Utilizes time-series regression, panel VAR, and Granger causality tests
- **Publication-Quality Visualizations**: Generates high-resolution figures suitable for academic publications

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection**: Gathers NFT transactions from Alchemy API for multiple brand categories
2. **Brand Equity Measurement**: Constructs a multi-dimensional brand equity framework
3. **Time-Series Regression**: Analyzes how brand equity dimensions affect NFT pricing and demand
4. **Panel VAR Analysis**: Examines dynamic causal relationships between brand metrics and market performance
5. **Brand Resilience Analysis**: Measures how brand strength affects value persistence during market fluctuations

## Brand Categories

The framework classifies NFT collections into four categories:
- **Established Fashion Brands**: Adidas, Nike/RTFKT, Gucci, Louis Vuitton, Burberry
- **Established Tech Brands**: Meta, Samsung, Twitter
- **Crypto-Native Projects**: BAYC, CryptoPunks, Moonbirds
- **Emerging Creators**: Invisible Friends, Doodles, Clone X, World of Women

## Brand Equity Metrics

The framework measures these dimensions of brand equity:

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Brand Awareness Index | Composite of social media mentions, Google Trends data |
| Brand Loyalty Score | Repeat buyer ratio, retention metrics |
| Perceived Quality Index | Community ratings, expert reviews weighted score |
| Premium Price Tolerance | Willingness to pay premium compared to category average |
| Brand Association Strength | Network centrality in brand association graphs |
| Brand Resonance Factor | Emotional connection metrics (social engagement intensity) |
| Brand Heritage Coefficient | Historical significance and established presence |
| Market Penetration Rate | Share of unique wallets interacting with brand vs. total market |
| Community Engagement Depth | Weighted interactions (Discord, Twitter) |
| Cross-Platform Presence | Multi-channel brand visibility |

## Technical Requirements

```
Python 3.8+
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
statsmodels
pmdarima
scikit-learn
networkx
pytrends
requests
tqdm
```

## Implementation Guide

1. **Setup Your Environment**:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn statsmodels pmdarima scikit-learn networkx pytrends requests tqdm
   ```

2. **Configure Alchemy API**:
   Update the API key and network settings:
   ```python
   API_KEY = 'your_alchemy_api_key'
   NETWORK = 'eth-mainnet'
   ```

3. **Execute the Analysis**:
   ```python
   analyzer = NFTBrandEquityAnalyzer(API_KEY, NETWORK)
   results = analyzer.run_full_analysis()
   ```

## Output

The framework generates:

1. **Publication-Ready Visualizations**:
   - Time trend charts by brand category
   - Regression coefficient heatmaps
   - Granger causality network diagrams
   - Brand equity correlation plots

2. **Statistical Results**:
   - Time-series regression models with robust standard errors
   - Panel VAR analysis with Granger causality tests
   - Brand strength correlation analysis

## Academic Significance

This framework allows researchers to:

1. **Test Brand Extension Theory** in digital asset markets
2. **Measure Brand Equity Persistence** across market cycles
3. **Isolate Causal Relationships** between brand dimensions and market performance
4. **Quantify Brand Premium** across different NFT categories

## Customization

The framework can be extended in several ways:

1. **Additional Brand Metrics**: Incorporate other dimensions of brand equity
2. **Alternative Data Sources**: Add social media sentiment, web traffic, or survey data
3. **Cross-Chain Analysis**: Compare brand effects across different blockchain ecosystems
4. **Demographic Segmentation**: Analyze how brand effects vary across buyer segments

## Limitations & Future Work

Current limitations include:
- Simulated brand equity data (can be replaced with actual metrics from social media APIs)
- Limited to Ethereum blockchain (can be extended to other chains)
- Focus on collection-level analysis (can be extended to individual NFT traits)

Future extensions:
- Incorporate NLP analysis of Discord/Twitter conversations
- Add computer vision analysis of visual brand elements
- Include cross-chain comparison
